# Face-recognition
The Face Recognition Software using python utilizes Image Recognition technology to enhance security measures and provide a user-friendly access control solution. The project aims to accurately identify individuals 
based on their unique facial features. Traditional security systems often rely on passwords or physical identification cards, which can be prone to unauthorized access. Face recognition technology offers a more robust and convenient alternative by 
analyzing distinct facial characteristics. This project focuses on developing a face recognition lock system that grants access to authenticated individuals upon successful face recognition. In summary, the Face Recognition Lock System project presents an 
efficient and secure access control solution using Image Recognition 
technology. The project report provides insights into the implementation 
process and demonstrates the potential of this system in enhancing 
security measures.
